    <p>
        JavaScript has never had any official solution for distributing packages, and every web platform (Rails, Django etc) has their own idea of how to structure and package JavaScript. In the last few years NPM has started becoming the canonical way of distribution, with Webpack as the build system, but thereâ€™s no way to load NPM packages in the browser without a server-side component.
