Hello. My name is Ole Halvor Smylings√•s and I'm a fullstack developer. I work with Angular JS, Node JS, Webpack, .Net Framework, MS SQL. This is mainly just my personal techno blog, I will try to update it from time to time with stuff I learn og figures out. If your're interrested check out my GitHub page or the project area here.
